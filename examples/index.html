Please have a look for the other licence types available for the image too.\n\n  * You may resize the picture to make it fit your website as long as you do not enlarge it or crop it significantly. If you want to make it look very different by cropping, or want to merge it with another picture for example, you need to ask if that is OK first, but it might cost more.\n\nThings you MUST do\n  *  When posting the picture you must credit the copyright holder prominently. [This information is available when you download the picture / The credit must read as shown above]. If you do not do this, you may need to pay a higher fee for a different licence which doesn't have this requirement.\n\nThings you MUST NOT do\n  *  Although we are giving you permission to use the picture, you do not now own the copyright. You do not have the right to do anything more with the picture other than the things outlined above. This licence is personal to you.  For example you cannot share the picture or allow others to use it. Other people need to get permission in the same way that you are doing.\n\n  * You promise that you will not use the picture in connection with anything illegal - for example (but not only these things) defamation or inciting racial or religious hatred.\n\n  * The picture you download will have certain hidden information attached to it (called 'metadata'). You must not remove or change any of it so that when the Picture is on your website all the metadata is still there. The metadata helps other people get their own licences from us if they find it on your site and want to use the picture as well.\n\nDelivery and storage\n  *  We deliver the picture file to you once, electronically, via a simple download button.\n\n  *  As well as the copy you upload to your website, you may retain a copy of the picture file for back-up so long as you securely store it. It is your responsibility to back up the image file. If you need us to deliver it to you again, you will need to pay a new licence fee to download it again.\n\nCancellation\n  * Please think carefully about whether you wish to purchase this licence before doing so.\n\n  *  If you change your mind and have not used the picture you can ask us to cancel our licence to you within 14 days and we'll refund your purchase price.  Please contact us at  the email address above.\n\n  * If you meet any problems with your right to use the picture, for example you are approached by someone else claiming that copyright in the picture belongs to them and that they have not given you the right to use it (an infringement claim) please let us know immediately and let us deal with the issue. It may turn out best for you to stop using the picture. Either you or we may reach this decision unilaterally and it is just possible that we need you to stop using the picture at some time in future. If that happens, or we need you to stop using the picture for some reason not described here, you will be entitled to a refund of the fee you have paid.  Please note that if we require you to stop using the picture, the refund of your purchase price will be your sole and exclusive remedy. For clarification, please contact us at the address shown above.\n\n  * If you fail to observe any of the requirements we ask of you in this Licence we reserve the right to alert you and insist that you do observe them, and if you fail to do so after a reasonable time we will cancel your Licence without any liability to you.\n\n  *  If this agreement is cancelled and/or you receive a refund for any reason you must remove the picture from your website and delete/destroy the picture file so that it cannot be used again in the future.\n\nAnd finally...\n  * We cannot guarantee that the picture will be suitable for your intended use. If a particular aspect of the picture is important to you - for example that the picture is of a specified location - please check the facts yourself. Unless stated, we cannot guarantee that there has been model release from any people in the picture - which means you need to be careful not to use the picture in any way which might imply something untrue or defamatory about any of the people in it.  If your choice of how you use the picture leads to complaint from people in the picture, you do so at your own risk and we reserve the right to terminate the licence.\n\n  * We need to keep information about our interaction with you - please read our Privacy Policy for more information.\n\n  * If you are unhappy about any aspect of our service to you please contact the email address above.\n\n  * This Licence is governed by the laws of England and Wales and you agree to the jurisdiction of the English courts.",
